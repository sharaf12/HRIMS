- Accent color: A lighter shade of green, such as lime green (#C0FF00), to create contrast on hover states and for call-to-action elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, to ensure a modern and objective look for all text elements.
- Use minimalist icons in white or light green (#C0FF00) to maintain consistency and readability against the dark background.
